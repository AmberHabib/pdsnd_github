### Project Title
Bikeshare data analysis for udacity data science nanodegree

### Description
In this project I have used R to answer three questions using the bikeshare data from Chicago, Newyork and Washington. The questions that have been addressed addressed are:
1. What are the most popular travel times in these cities?
2. What is the total and average travel time?
3. What are the counts of each user type? What are the counts by gender?

### Files used
files were supplied by udacity, i believe these ar cleaned up versions of the files below:
[Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
[Newyork](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
[Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)
