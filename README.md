### Project Title
Bikeshare data analysis for Udacity data science nanodegree with R

### Description
In this project I have used R to answer three questions using the bikeshare data from Chicago, Newyork and Washington. The questions that have been addressed are:
1. What are the most popular travel times in these cities?
2. What is the total and average travel time?
3. What are the counts of each user type? What are the counts by gender?

### Files used
Files were supplied by Udacity, I believe these are cleaned up versions of the files below:
* [Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
* [Newyork](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
* [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)

### Credits
#### Big thanks to: ####
* Udacity instructor notes
* stack overflow for help with syntax
* my 6 year old daughter, who helped in choosing the color palette for the plots :)
